			<h1>So, you want to be a AAAS Mass Media Fellow</h1> 																											<!-- Put your title here -->
			<p>If you've made it to this page, you're likely planning on applying to the AAAS Mass Media Fellowship so best of luck! I was a Mass Media Fellow in 2021 at The Wichita Eagle. On this page, you'll find my application materials as well as tips I received when I applied for the fellowship. For the 2022 cohort, the application is slightly different so not everything will be relevant here. Unfortunately, I don't have any knowledge of what actually happens during the evaluation process so take these tips with a grain of salt. For official tips, visit the <a href="https://www.aaas.org/programs/mass-media-science-engineering-fellows/application-tips" target="_blank">AAAS Mass Media Fellowship tip page</a>.</p>
			
			<a href='#application_materials'>Jump to my application materials</a>
			<p></p>
			
			<h2>The AAAS MMF application process</h2>
			<p>The <a href="https://www.aaas.org/fellowships/mass-media/apply" target="_blank">application</a> opens in October and closes in early January. Make sure not to wait until the last minute to get started. There is a lot of writing to do!</p>
			
			<p>In the first stage, you will submit an application, answer a few questions, submit a general writing sample, and a sample "news" story.</p>
			
			<p>If you make it past this stage, you will then fill out the semi-finalist survey. Here, you will answer questions about logistics and what sites you would be interested in being placed at. If you are awarded a fellowship, it is for a specific site. If you have a preference for which site that would be, this stage is where you will voice it.</p>
			
			<p>The next stage depends as much on your credentials as it does your fit with the site. There are many more qualified applicants than there are spots so whether you match with a site will be key to whether you become a finalist. If you do become a finalist, you will have an interview with the program director and learn which site(s) have expressed interest in you. The interview will focus on both fit with the specifics of the site as well as give you time to ask any questions you have.</p>
			
			<p>If you make it past that stage, congratulations, you are a AAAS Mass Media Fellow!</p>
			
			
			<h2>General AAAS MMF application tips</h2>
			</p>Before diving into the specific sections, there are a few general tips that work for most if not all job/fellowship/scholarship applications.</p>
			
			<p>First, make sure you have the appropriate framing. Yes, it is an application, but it is also a marketing pitch. You are selling 400 hours of time (40hr/week * 10 weeks) and you want one of the sites to buy your time and not one of the other applicants'. How are you going to convince them?</p>
			
			<p>Your application is the first part of that, but the goal of the application isn't to get them to "buy" your time. Instead, the goal of the application is to get an interview where you will convince them you are the right person.</p>
			
			<p>As such, everything in your application should communicate that you either have the skills needed to be successful or you have the skills to learn the skills you will need to be successful. As a fellow, you will need to make use of some subset of the following skills: identifying potential stories, learning a new topic quickly, interviewing sources, using data to tell a story (interviews are just qualitative data), storytelling for general audiences, communicating technical concepts in plain language/translating jargon, juggling multiple projects at a time, using content management systems to publish stories, using search engine optimization and social media to promote stories, and working with people who have different backgrounds than yourself. If you have experiences that demonstrate any of these, include them somewhere in your application!</p>
			
			<p>Finally, have an idea of the type of outlet you want to be placed at and focus your application around experiences that translate well to those outlets/sites. In my opinion, the sites can be categorized as national or regional focusing on writing, radio, or video. For example, my site, The Wichita Eagle, would be classified as a regional outlet with a writing focus because it was a daily newspaper for Wichita, Kansas.</p>
			
			
			<h2>Tips for the application questions/candidate statement</h2>
			<p>For the first part of the writing questions, you will need to provide answers to seven prompts. While answering the question should be your first goal, don't forget these questions also serve as writing samples. 250 words might not seem like much for an application, but it is a substantial amount for a news story that might only be a few hundred words long. If you can't get to your point quickly in these questions, you are doing to have a hard time doing so when your editor tells you have a 750 word limit to cover an entire scientific study (disclaimer: I did not have a word limit for articles, but some fellows did).</p>
			
			<p>To help you do so, consider using the <a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/journalism_and_journalistic_writing/the_inverted_pyramid.html" target="_blank">inverted pyramid model</a>. First, give the big point you want to make. This is the one sentence answer to the question. Second, you say why it matters (i.e. why it is relevant to the fellowship if it isn't obvious). Finally, you give the details supporting your claim. You might find this method of writing difficult at first because it is the exact opposite of how we write in science. Fight your impulse to start with the details and build to the conclusion!</p>
			
			<p>For example, to answer the question <em>What in your background has prepared you for this fellowship?</em>, your answer could start with "My experience with X, Y, and Z has prepared me for this fellowship because I developed/used/learned [some skill needed for the fellowship]. In X, I....." Notice how your answer gave the reviewer everything they needed to know in the first sentence. This is what "master the art of going in-depth and staying succinct" from the tips page means in practice.</p>
			
			<p>Some of other things to consider:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Despite what my English teachers in high school told me, you don't need to use all 250 words. Use the minimum amount you need to communicate your point.</li>
				<li>Some questions sound like they ask about similar things. Don't repeat your answers though. Tailor your experiences to wherever they fit best.</li>
				<li>For media experience, adopt a broad definition. Sure journalism counts, but don't forget about blogging, podcasts, radio appearances, website content, video, and using social media for science communication.
				<li>For experience you have, don't get too caught up on the "prestige" of the outlet where your work is published. No one is expecting you to have something published in the New York Times. Remember that your goal is showing you have the skills to be successful.</li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<h2>General Writing Sample</h2>
			<p>For this part of the application, you can choose to write about almost anything science related. While you can write something new, you can also use previous work too. Personally, if you have any recent clips (or published non-academic writings), I'd recommend you use one of those. If your article has already made it by an editor to get published, you've already had someone look over your work and you are also showing your experience. If you have something similar to what your target outlet publishes, even better!</p>
			
			<p>If you have multiple published pieces or are starting from scratch, you have more freedom in what you write here. One thing to consider is how you are showing your "range." It's almost certain that most of your stories as a fellow will be outside of your research/education background so you want your application to communicate that you can write about more than one research topic. That doesn't mean you have to cover completely different areas (e.g. biology and physics), but you probably shouldn't have all your writing samples focus on particle physics, for example.</p>
			
			<p>Personally, I think that this part of the writing samples is easier to show that on rather than the sample news story. You can also show your range with the supporting material part of the application but make sure that your best work is showcased in the general writing sample.</p>
			
			<p><i>Example</i>: For my application, I used a story I published in a local newspaper about the pandemic possibly creating teaching shortages due to international students not being able to get visas in time for the semester. My sample news piece was also about education but included a technology component with virtual reality in the classroom. Both were in education, but the sample news story allowed me to also bring in technology.</p>
			
			
			<h2>Sample News Story</h2>
			<p>Speaking of the sample news story, let's talk about how to write the other major part of your application. If you haven't published a news story before, this is your chance to show the application reviewers that you can do it.</p>
			
			<p>To make things easier for yourself, I'd recommend picking a study near your area of expertise but not directly what you study. That way, you are approaching the topic with some expertise, but are also somewhat of an outsider who isn't too deep in the subfield-specific jargon.</p>
			
			<p>When picking a story, you aren't restricted to top-tier journals like Science and Nature. Lesser known journals can also provide interesting stories. If you using a story from a less prestigious journal, looking for papers with a university press release, an editor's suggestion, or a high Altmetric score can help you determine if the paper is newsworthy or interesting enough. If you picked a paper in an area near your own research, you probably have an idea of this already.</p>
			
			<p>For picking a study, you can also consider the work of colleagues you've met at conferences. You are encouraged (read highly recommended) to include quotes from the researchers in your sample news article and it's much easier to get someone's time if you already know them. In general, you will want to avoid anyone you have a direct conflict of interest with (e.g. your advisor), but if you do have a conflict of interest, just mention it in your article. For example, I had worked with some of the authors of the paper I chose before and at the end of the my sample story, I included the line "Disclaimer: The author has previously worked with some of the authors of the study but was not involved in the study discussed here." Not only did I make the writing process easier by already knowing the author, but with the disclaimer, I communicated I had knowledge of journalism ethics.</p>
			
			<p>Once you've picked a study, you're ready to start think about how to write the story. Some general tips for that:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>I already mentioned interviewing, but you should reach out to the corresponding author (or the author you know) and ask for a meeting to talk about their paper. You can/should tell them that it is for a job application, and you will be writing a sample news story. Some people do publish their sample news story as a freelance article so if you are planning to do that, be upfront about it. You should also reach out to someone not involved in the study for outside comment and their opinion on the study. If you picked a study in your field, you probably already have some people in mind. If not, looking at the references in the study or university expert guides (Google something like [University Name] expert database) can be useful for determining who might be qualified to speak on the topic. Make sure to read the paper before you do an interview so you have good questions to ask.</li>
				<li>When drafting your article, use the quotes to drive the story. That means you need to think about what you want to say in your article before you do the interview. Typically, a summary of the findings, an analogy about the methods, or an opinion about why the study was needed make for good quotes. Remember that as a journalist, you aren't supposed to give your opinions in the story. You are supposed to report the facts and what others have said. If you need opinion in the story, you need your interviewees to say it. For example, if the study is the first of its kind or represents the first time something has been done/observed, you can say that because it is a fact. If it is an advance over current technology, that is an opinion so you need an interviewee or some other source to say that.</li>
				<li>In journalism, you will need to answer the 5 "W"s and 1 "H" in almost every story. You should do this in the first few paragraphs or sentences of your article. This mini-summary of the rest of the article is often called the nutgraph or billboard. For coverage of a study, the nutgraph might look something like this: Yesterday [when], researchers [who] at State University [where] published a study about X finding Y [what/how]. The results help clarify/suggest/provide insight into Z [why].</li>
				<li>Make sure to give your audience something to takeaway at the end of your story. Typically, this will be an extension of the work or an unanswered question. If your source hasn't already mentioned it when answering one of your other questions, make sure to ask directly.</li>
				<li>Remember that you are not writing an academic paper. That means you should write in active voice and limit jargon or technical language. In addition, you don't need to write in multi-sentence paragraphs. It is perfectly acceptable (and if you are at a regional/local newspaper, encouraged) to have 1-2 sentence paragraphs. Read a few articles published by the sites you are interested in to get a sense of what their style is.</li>
				<li>While it is supposed to be a joke, this Guardian column about science writing is fairly accurate in terms of what a typical science story layout is: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-lay-scientist/2010/sep/24/1" target="_blank">This is a news website article about a scientific paper</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<h2>The optional supporting materials</h2>
			<p>This part of the application is new for 2022 so how best to use this portion of the application will depend on your personal preferences. In the past, applicants had to submit two references and had the option of submitting one more reference and up to two more writing samples. Given that the number of documents you can submit is four, I would guess that keeping the model of two references/letters of recommendation and two more writing samples is probably what the reviewers have in mind.</p>
			
			<p>If you chose to go with letters of recommendation, you will want to have people who know you well and can comment on different areas of your experience. If you have done science communication work, public engagement, or media work before, your supervisor for those projects would be a good choice provided they know you well enough to give a strong recommendation. This isn't an academic position so you can have non-academics provide a recommendation.</p>
			
			<p>When asking for letters of recommendation, don't be afraid to ask them what they will write about or tell them what you want them to focus on. If you have specific areas you want them to cover, let them know. If they've advised or worked with past fellows, ask them to mention that in their questionnaires and make a comparison where you stack up well to that previous fellow. For example, a letter that includes "having worked with [previous fellow's name] (MMF 'xx),I believe [your name]'s writing/communication abilities are on par with them and would make a similar impact as a fellow" not only establishes that your letter writer understands what is expected in the program and adds validity to their comments, but it also establishes that you are qualified for the position.</p>
			
			<p>For the additional media samples, I went with an opinion piece I wrote for Scientific American and an opinion article for Physics Today. In terms of advice for these, I would recommend thinking about how you can show a skill you have that you haven't yet talked about in your application. Is there a different topic you can write about, a different style, a different audience, etc.?</p>

			<h2>My application materials</h2>
			<p>Now that I've shared some tips on the application, here's how I put them into practice. These were directly copied so any typos here were also in my application.</p>
			
			
			<h3>Applicant questionnaire (2021 cohort version)</h3>
			<p><strong>1. Why are you, as a scientist or engineer, interested in participating in this program?</strong></p>
			<p>I am interested in this program because I want to lower access barriers to scientific knowledge, spread scientific knowledge, and strengthen my skills around science writing. I come from a low-income background and without science media such as news articles and books, I wouldn’t be a scientist today. I knew nothing about scientific journals or how scientists share research. My only connection to science was the media. </p>
			<p>Through this fellowship, I hope to pay it forward and share my passion for science with others. As someone who was starting out in research recently, I know that interpreting science and its jargon can be challenging. I want to use the skills I’ve developed as a scientist and writer to make science more understandable and accessible. Working in the environment the AAAS Mass Media Fellowship provides would help me accomplish that.</p>
			
			<p><strong>2. What in your background has prepared you for this fellowship?</strong></p>
			<p>I’m prepared for this fellowship because I’m already writing about science topics, working with journalists and communicators, and developing my journalism skill set.</p>
			<p>I created the now American Astronomical Society supported blog PERbites, where I practice writing about research for general audiences by highlighting recent publications. I’ve covered over 60 studies, focusing on how the results apply to a classroom or university department. Through this blog, I’ve also developed my editorial skills by supervising other writers and providing feedback on their articles.</p>
			<p>Through Michigan State University’s Hub for Innovation in Learning and Technology, I collaborate with the university communications team to develop and implement a strategy for sharing project results with the university and local community. I’ve learned to communicate research to diverse audiences through various media and adapt my strategy based on the audience.</p>
			<p>To strengthen my journalism skills, I’ve participated in two professional development workshop series led by veteran journalists. Through these workshops, I learned the basics of identifying potential stories and sources, interviewing, and reporting stories. One workshop led to a reported piece for a local newspaper.</p>
			<p>I’ve also attended science writing and science communication conferences such as the ScienceWriters conference, Science Talk, and ComSciCon-AIP. Through these, I’ve learned about different types and methods of journalism and taken workshops to learn specific tools. For example, using Columbia University’s Workbench platform for data journalism.</p>
			
			<p><strong>3. How do you think the skills learned from the fellowship will impact your future career or academic plans?</strong></p>
			<p>I’m an education researcher in a physics department. The success of my career depends on communicating with people who do not do the same research as me or any research. Whether my audience is physicists who may be skeptical of education research, administrators looking to make evidence-informed decisions, or students worried about their own learning, I need to be able to succinctly communicate my results and why they matter.</p>
			<p>Further, I am biased toward action. I don’t want my research ideas to stop after the journal publication. Instead, I want my research to have a real-world impact. I need to be able to learn my audiences’ concerns and present the full story rather than just one side. Journalists are proficient in these skills and I can’t imagine a better place to learn these skills than immersing myself in a science communication fellowship for 10 weeks.</p>

			<p><strong>4. Have you had previous media-related experiences? Please provide details.</strong></p>
			<p>I have experience in traditional media such as news and radio as well as social media. I’ve worked with a local journalist to produce a story for the Lansing State Journal about how the coronavirus restrictions may create teaching shortages at Michigan universities. I interviewed multiple administrators at my university and a nearby university. Initially, I pursued a different story, but through the interviews, I learned that story wasn’t as newsworthy as I had thought. Instead, I learned how to construct a story driven by insights from my interviews.</p>
			<p> Outside of my reporting experience, I talked about my research on a local radio station, learning best practices for communicating my work conversationally for a broad audience and doing so without visual aids.</p>
			<p>I’ve also served as the social media manager for a science communication student organization and for my research lab. Through these experiences, I’ve learned to communicate science in engaging, Twitter-sized snippets, infographics, and videos.</p>
			
			<p><strong>5. Describe any activities, other than previous media experiences, you have undertaken that involved increasing public understanding of science and technology.</strong></p>
			<p>The activity I’m proudest about is organizing an international, virtual science art exhibition this past year. My team recruited nearly 60 scientists and artists to share their science-themed artwork, covering topics as small as viruses to as large as the universe itself. The exhibition reached people in 29 countries spread across 6 continents! Through this experience, I learned the importance of exploring alternative media for communicating science and that doing so can reach audiences who may not engage in typical science outreach events.</p>
			<p>Outside of the art exhibition, I’ve participated in informal science conversations. For example, I’ve given talks about my research through a Science-on-Tap type event at a local bar and served as a panelist for a public Q&A science session hosted by my university.</p>
			
			<p><strong>6. What community outreach or educational activities have you participated in, science-related or otherwise?</strong></p>
			<p>Outside of the activities listed above, I’ve participated in outreach events targeted at kids. For example, I designed science activities for middle school students as part of a summer camp hosted by the Michigan State University Women and Minorities in the Physical Sciences. Through this experience, I learned how to present science content in an engaging way.</p>
			<p>I’ve also been a pen pal to a low-income middle school student through Letters to a Prescientist. Through this experience, I learned to relate science to someone’s daily life and their interests. While my pen pal was initially indifferent to science, they were asking me to send along more science activities for them to do by the end of the program!</p>
			
			
			
			<h3>Writing Sample</h3>
			<p><em>Copied verbatum from my article in the <a href="https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/local/2020/07/29/pandemic-travel-restrictions-could-mean-ta-shortage-msu/5531121002/" target="_blank">Lansing State Journal</a>.</em></p>
			
			<p>Graduate teaching assistants taught more than 27,000 students at Michigan State University, last year, nearly half the student body.</p>

			<p>Yet, with travel restrictions and delayed visa processing this year, there may be shortages in teaching assistants for the fall semester.</p>

			<p>Some departments are expecting to have empty teaching assistant slots at the same time they may need to teach more classes than usual because of social distancing requirements.</p>

			<p>Other departments may have teaching assistants who cannot come to campus teach online, possibly requiring international students to work in the middle of the night from the other side of the world.</p>

			<p>“We will have to wind up working to get enough students to fill all the teaching assistantships needed” Gary Blanchard, the associate chair for education for the chemistry department said.</p>

			<p>The Department of Chemistry’s classes do not transition easily to online, in part because the department runs many laboratory courses, which require the teaching assistants to be present.</p>

			<p>During a typical year, the Chemistry Department hires around 130 teaching assistants, or one in six teaching assistants employed by the university. But due to travel and visa restrictions, the department is expecting as many as 30 of those graduate students to be unable to make it to campus and take those positions.</p>

			<p>If we’re going to be missing 30 people who we were counting on, we got a little scrambling to do to make sure we’re covered in order to teach,” Blanchard said.</p>

			<p>Further, this year is not a typical year. With smaller class sizes required to fulfill social distancing guidelines, the department may need to offer more sections and hence, need to hire more teaching assistants than previous years.</p>

			<p>“Shrinking sections sizes to be able to accommodate in-person teaching when we might want to do in-person teaching might require that we need more sections and therefore more people” Thomas Jeitschko, the dean of the Graduate School and associate provost for graduate education said.</p>

			<p>One solution is to convert graduate students employed as research assistants to teaching assistants.</p>

			<p>However, having previously paused their research in response to Governor Whitmer’s “Stay Home, Stay Safe” order, faculty and graduate students may be reluctant to take more time away from their research.</p>

			<p>“In principle, we have the bodies that we need to cover the job. The problem is that the faculty want the graduate students and the graduate students want to be doing research because the research is what gets them their PhD,” Blanchard said.</p>

			<p>Additionally, like other teachers, graduate students may not feel comfortable teaching an in-person class, especially if they or a family member are at an increased risk for severe illness.</p>

			<p>The Graduate Employees Union, which represents Michigan State University teaching assistants, said in a statement that all teaching assistants should be “able to request and be granted remote assignments.”</p>

			<p>Departments teaching most of their classes online are not exempt from these staffing concerns. Nearly half of the incoming graduate students who would serve as teaching assistants for the Department of Computer Science and Department of Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering are international students. Many will not be coming to campus this fall and will need to teach from their home countries. For teaching assistants from China, an afternoon class at Michigan State University would be a middle-of-the-night class in Beijing.</p>

			<p>Further, US embassies and consulates remain closed and are only taking emergency	appointments, meaning that international students cannot obtain visas. Without visas, departments are uncertain whether they can even hire graduate students who are not physically in the United States.</p>

			<p>“[We] don’t have full information on how that will work with respect to immigration issues,” Sandeep Kulkarni, the computer science graduate program director said. “There are open questions in terms of are we allowed to pay a student who isn’t physically here.”</p>

			<p>These potential problems are not only a concern at Michigan State. Many universities are faced with similar situations.</p>

			<p>Administrators at the University of Michigan, which is also planning to offer a mix of in-person and online instruction, have expressed similar concerns about graduate students being able to teach in the fall semester.</p>

			<p>“For students who start as graduate student instructors, every effort will be made to enable them to begin in those roles.” John Godfrey, the assistant dean of the Rackham Graduate School said. “All of this is in anticipation that at some point in late summer or early fall, U.S. consulates will start to reopen and schedule visa appointments.”</p>

			<p>Concerns about teaching assistants might not only be a short-term concern, however.</p>

			<p>First-year graduate students fill many teaching assistant positions. Whether a similar situation could occur in future years depends on how many people decide to attend graduate school.</p>

			<p>Given widespread unemployment, future graduate school enrollment may depend on how quickly the economy recovers. Those seeking employment may find that earning a graduate degree opens new opportunities, a trend the chemistry department has seen in the past.</p>

			<p>“When the economy is good, the incoming class is smaller. When the economy is bad, the incoming classes get bigger,” Blanchard said. “We don’t know how fast or to what extent the economy will recover.”</p>

			<p>At this point, though, it may be too early to tell.</p>

			<p>“What we expect to see in the coming years, we’re in a waiting game. Everyone is.” Godfrey
			said.</p>




			<h3>Sample News Story</h3>

			<h4>Learning from Virtual Reality isn’t an immediate reality</h4>

			<h5>A new study suggests users need time to adjust to a virtual reality environment before they can learn science from it.</h5>

			<p>If you consider yourself as someone who has problems visualizing things in 3D, you aren’t alone.</p>


			<p>The world is three-dimensional but learning tools such as textbooks, videos, and diagrams are two-dimensional. As a result, interest in using virtual reality for learning has skyrocketed. </p>

			<p>Virtual reality, or VR, allows the user to view and interact with a virtual 3D space. While in principle virtual reality offers many new opportunities for learning, the science hasn’t necessarily shown that. </p>

			<p>A new paper by Ohio State University researchers suggests that the lack of learning may be because virtual reality is still too new of a technology and hence, introducing students to virtual reality before using it as an educational tool may help.</p>

			<p>“We were bending over backwards trying to find [evidence of improved learning from virtual reality] but we weren’t seeing it. We had long suspected that at least one factor could be that there’s cognitive overload,” said Chris Porter, the study’s lead author. “People are not accustomed to the VR learning environment and so it’s pretty hopeless to teach them anything while they are awed and overwhelmed by the medium.”</p>

			<p>To test their hypothesis, the researchers created virtual models of 3D phenomenon that often are part of university students’ first year physics classes. Some students played a short VR game before viewing a VR
			lesson while other students only viewed the VR lesson. To measure their learning, both groups of students later took a test in the virtual reality environment as well as a test of the concepts presented in a traditional online, two-dimensional format.</p>

			<p>While both groups of students scored equally well on the tests, their performance on the lesson differed. Those who played the VR game before viewing the lesson did slightly better than students who didn’t play the game.</p>

			<p>“It was not an impressive [improvement], they were pretty small, but it was from only 5 minutes of play,” Porter said. “This seemed to indicate that if it were important to use VR in instruction, then you can
			improve student’s engagement with it through the use of play and preliminary training and just repeated exposure.”</p>

			<p>Other researchers were not surprised that playing in the VR environment first helped the students but expressed concern that the experiment may not have been designed well enough to determine if students were learning.</p>

			<p>“It makes sense because the vast majority of people don’t have experience with virtual reality technology,” said Jared Canright, a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow and VR researcher at the University of Washington. “They had a really equivalent VR versus non-VR treatment, and I feel that that design choice is pretty fundamentally dooming. Because if you can have an experience you consider equivalent on a screen to the one you are showing in VR, chances are you are not making good use of VR.”</p>

			<p>Even though virtual reality wasn’t as beneficial for learning as the researchers hoped, it still showed promise as a tool for creating interest about the science concepts.</p>

			<p>“The group that gets the VR experience always says that they
			enjoyed it more than the other groups,” Porter said. “It’s like an instant
			student enthusiasm tool.”</p>
