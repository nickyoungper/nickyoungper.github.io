						<h2>Recent Work</h2>
							<p>Here's what I've been up. The projects are in reverse chronological order.</p>

							<h3>Understanding Graduate Admissions in Physics (Michigan State University) </h3>
							<p>As physics has remained one of the least diverse STEM fields, increasing attention is directed toward the admission practices of graduate programs.
							There are many components to a quality graduate application and I am interested in how those components of the application influence whether the admission
							committee will accept or reject the student. </p>
							
							<p>For this project, I've collected admissions records from multiple universities including MSU. I then use the Random Forest algorithm to determine which 
							features of the application are most predictive of an applicant being admitted to a program. </p>
							
							<h3>PERbites</h3>
							<p><a href='http://www.perbites.org' />PERbites</a> is a site devoted to making the results of physics education accessible to those outside of the PER community. 
							The site is one of about a dozen in the ScienceBites community, which consists of graduate students and postdocs from around the world working to present their 
							research fields in understandable ways to those outside of the field.</p>

							<h3>Using Random Forests to determine important features for integrating computation into physics courses (Michigan State University)</h3>
							<p>Random Forests are a powerful machine learning algorithm to understand complex data sets. In this project, I used Random Forests to understand why physics
							faculty choose to include computation/programming in their physics courses. I found that using computation in their research with students or believing that 
							computation allows one to bring in new physics and new problems into the classroom are the biggest predictors.</p>
							
							<h3>Student Understanding of Period, Frequency, and Angular Frequency (The Ohio State University)</h3>
							<p>In this project, I investigated student difficulties with determining the period, frequenc	y, and angular frequency from graphical and mathematical representations.
							The goals of this project were to determine what these difficulties are, determine if the skills needed to answer period, frequency, and angular frequency are arranged
							hierarchically, and determine if any found difficulties can be overcome with limited skills practice.</p>

							<h3>Photonics Careers Project (Rochester Institute of Technology)</h3>
							<p>The goal of this project is to understand how technicians, engineers, and researchers transition from school to the workplace. I specifically focused on how math is 
							used in the workplace.<p>
							<p> More information about the project can be found at <a href='http://www.rit.edu/power' />www.rit.edu/power</a></p>

							<h3>C3PO: Customizable Computer Coaches for Physics Online (University of Minnesota)</h3>
							<p>C3PO builds off of the University of Minnesota's previous problem solving work to construct online coaches to help students solve specific, context-rich problems 
							based on their problem solving technique. My role in the project was to update one of the version 1 oscillatory motion coaches, which used a linear progression through
							the problem, into a version 2 coach, which use a nonlinear structure and allow the student to take alternative routes to the solution.</p>

							<p>To learn more and try out some of the coaches, head to the <a href='http://c3poclass.spa.umn.edu/PhysicsTutor/index.jsp' /> C3PO coach interface</a></p>
